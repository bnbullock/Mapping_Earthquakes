# Mapping_Earthquakes


## Project Overview

Working with our clients, we have been able to create a webpage with 2 different maps along with an earthquake overlay showing world wide earthquakes that have taken place in the last 7 days. Our clients are now interested in comparing the locations of earthquakes to the earth's tectonic plates. They would like to add a map overlay with this information. They would also like a second selection that allows for only viewing earthquakes that have a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. And finally they think it's a good idea to add a third map to the webpage that allows for additional flexibility moving forward.

- Deliverables:
  1. Create overlay with Tectonic Plate Data
  2. Create overlay with Major Earthquake Data
  3. Create an additional Map
